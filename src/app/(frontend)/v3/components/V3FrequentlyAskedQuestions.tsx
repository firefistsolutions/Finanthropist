          question: 'How much money do I need to start trading after the course?',
          answer:
            'You can start with as little as â‚¹5,000. We teach you to grow gradually. Many students start small and build their capital over time. The focus is on learning proper risk management first, then scaling up as your confidence and skills grow.',
